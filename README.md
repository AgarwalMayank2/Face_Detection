# problem statement
Face Identification: Identify a face image by classifying to one of K classes. Extract LBP, HoG and CNN Features using the code provided and compare different techniques. <br>
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset <br>

# what is in this repo
## docs
contains files to serve project webpage, like html, css, javascript files. This folder is being build by gihub after every change in it
## processing_dataset
contains ipynb file about how we are processing original dataset and making it usable for applying basic ML techniques to solve problem
## processed_dataset
contains processed dataset csv files, and google drive link for HoG featured dataset. In processed dataset there are 158 persons with atleast 10 images of them.
also there is ipynb file given to show how to use these datasets without downloading on google colab or in your local machine (for CNN and LBP featured dataset)
## applying_ML_algorithms
contains ipynb files that belongs to different ML classification techniques to identify face in images (each file is maintained by our team members)
